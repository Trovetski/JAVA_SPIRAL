# JAVA_SPIRAL
an app that draws beautiful spirals of square, triangle and circles.
The app is allows you to change the density and number of spirals.
written completly in java.

*NOTE*
the first button is square, the second circle and third is triangle.
Pardon me but when I wrote this I hardcoded the icon locations so they
wont be visible.
